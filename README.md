LISP INTERPRETER
================

This is an interpreter for a subset of common lisp defined in a programming language course.
It does not follow a proper object oriented architecture and instead settles for bunch of static methods residing in classes like Helper. This deviation was intentional and was chosen to make the program look and perform very similar to the interpreter written in lisp.
